## 🐛 Problems You're Seeing

1. **"How are you?" → Gets FAQ about alcohol** ❌
2. **Responses are truncated mid-sentence** ❌
3. **Not conversational** ❌

## ✅ Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: Greeting Detection (`app.py`)
Now detects greetings and returns friendly welcome message.

### Fix 2: Longer Responses (`faq_bot.py`)
Increased from 500 → 1000 characters, keeps 5 sentences instead of 3.
